It's my first project,which I made by myself! 

I used the following tools: ___Java(1.8), Spring Framework,Maven, Thymeleaf, Database MySQL.___

### The user can 
register, log in, log out, view the car catalog, place an order, view their orders, cancel the order.

### The admin can
add and remove a car from the catalog, delete a user or make him an admin, view and edit applications.
